    <h3>We're a student-faculty team dedicated to opening and analyzing Harvard data to empower our community members to improve campus life.</h3>
</div>

<p>We've teamed up with the former deputy CTO of the US, Harvard's CTO, and Harvard's Chief Digital Officer to build Harvard's first open data catalog​. We're empowering Harvard students to hack with Harvard data including admissions data, course catalogs, dhall menus, and university finances.​</p>

<p>Our main work includes:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Gathering open data from around the Harvard community</li>
    <li>Analyzing and visualizing the data, or building applications around it</li>
    <li>Using these results to drive policy changes around Harvard</li>
    <li>Empowering Harvard students to also hack with this data to improve student life or the University</li>
</ul>

<p>As we expand, we're looking for people with a passion for anything from data science to public policy. Join our team to ​build our web frontend and data analysis tools, create visualizations and apps with Harvard data, work closely with our mentors in the civic tech space, and craft university-wide open data policies.</p>

            <p>This graph depicts a few of the most serious felonies committed in Cambridge. On a very positive note, robbery and aggravated assault have seen a steady decline in frequency over a three year span. Unfortunately, dating violence and stalking have increased continually. Rape and burglary reached an all time high at the end of 2014 after reaching an all time low in 2013.</p>

            <p>This graph depicts the fees Harvard college students pay on an annual basis. Tuition has been steadily increasing in a linear fashion and has now become $40,000. Health services fees have stayed relatively constant and comprise a minute amount of the total fees for Harvard college. Student Services Fee have been steadily increasing annually $40 to $90. Additionally, Room and Board fees have slowly increased as well over the past two decades.</p>

            <p>The number of Latino and multiracial students has increased dramatically in recent years, but that might be due to changes in self-reporting as people stop writing "Non specified" and use a more accurate label instead. The number of Asian students has stayed relatively consistent for the past few years between 15-20%. African American student numbers have stayed nearly the same as well.</p>

            <p>This graph shows the ratio of financial aid to tuition for each school at Harvard based on 2013 data. We see that the Medical School provides the least financial aid per dollar of tuition paid (40%) while the Divinity School actually gives out more financial aid than it takes in as tuition (130%), perhaps due to student stipends. Harvard College offers less financial aid than most other schools.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The goal of the Harvard Open Data Project (HODP) is to leverage open data to foster community, efficiency, and student innovation. Making data public and easily accessible allows us all to unlock its potential. Data-driven progress unites people, organizations, and departments as we all try to make daily life better. Aggregating, maintaining, and publicizing open data has and will continue to be a global trend and we want Harvard to be at its forefront. Our goal is to give that progress a home with centralization of available data, integration with existing systems, and showcases of data-inspired products.</p>

<p>Students from across the University are spearheading a project to build Harvard's first open data portal, which will empower Harvard students and researchers to discover and hack with University data like financial data, enrollment stats, course catalogs, and more.</p>
